    <p>The clan piranha is a disgustingly effective brawler for a light mech. It packs assault class melee damage (64 charge damage), medium class speed (5/8) and armor (same as a hbk), and light class weaponry (5xsl), serving in effect as a medium &#039;mech with a weight problem (or gravitationally challenged by today&#039;s politically correct standards). The big difference i emphasize the assault melee mech to have stealth so it will take less damage then the medium that has some more tanking function to it also the shield mod on this medium frame has an increased sensor signature penalty so adding stealth would make little sense.</p>
